== OAS file

https://api.stoplight.io/v1/versions/9WaNJfGpnnQ76opqe/export/oas.json[Official OAS file] has several problems{nbsp}:

* WS operation are not tagged. So they are all generated in the `default_api` file.
* API parameters is incomplete.
  For example, `/search/movie` operation only has two parameters `year` and `primary_release_year`.
  https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/search/search-movies[Documentation] mentions 5 more parameters, including a required `query` parameter.
* Response schemas are inlined.
  So, generated code cannot infer a functional name and code is difficult to read.

== Problem documentation

Theses problems (and their cause) are explained in the forum:

* https://www.themoviedb.org/talk/5ab9c36b0e0a26364500dff6[OAS json doesn't match documentation...]
* https://www.themoviedb.org/talk/58b926d992514160840085fd[Swagger generator produces bad-named models]

== Correction

To solve theses problems, we update the OAS file manually before code generation.

[NOTE]
====
Several operations responses are little variations of the same objet: `movie`, `movie-with-rating`, `movie-with-dates`, `movie-with-media-type` for example.
When this case occurs, I fusion all theses fields in a unique `movie` object, to avoid a lot of duplication in generated models.

== Client code generation

Client code generation is now based on this custom OAS file:

[code, bash]
----
java -jar ${PATH_TO_OPENAPI_CLI_JAR}/openapi-generator-cli.jar generate \
-i ${PROJECT_ROOT}/tmdb_oas.json \
--skip-validate-spec \
-g rust \
--library reqwest \
-o ${DESTINATION}/tmdb-client-rs
----
